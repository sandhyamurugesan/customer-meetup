#My proudest achievement 

Last year I was put into a project with Swisscom which I had to work on the whole by myself from requirements, design, implementation, test and delivery.
There was no one to even brainstorm about the algorithms except for the client. 
I had one goal that I should deliver my best here.
Being a Technology agnostic person, quickly learnt iron python and Spotfire for this project.

Constant communication was required due to the newness and complexity.
Ensured that the there is no gap in requirements and implementation.
Earned their trust in the first successful algorithm delivery.
It was a very challenging project because of the time and resource constraints.

After my first company, I have worked in few startups that have helped to be aware of the end-to-end delivery, else this would have been a difficult task. 
I have learnt mainly in startups that, 

* How to handle adhoc work. 
* How to write test cases so that it's easier for continuous delivery.
* How to communicate with the client and keep them informed. Be open to new ideas.
* Mentor and collaborate for quality product.
* To be versatile on whatever technology comes up. 
* Understanding the core of any language/framework helps in being updated.
